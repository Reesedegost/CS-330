Project Overview
In my 3D scene, I created a playful underwater world inspired by Conch Street on the SpongeBob SquarePants show. It features key landmarks like Squidward's house, represented as a tall, tapered cylinder with reflective glass windows; Patrick's house, constructed as a half sphere with a cylinder made antennae; and SpongeBob's house, a three stacked cylinder structure with pointy cone leaves on top. The backdrop is a sandy beach, and a floating jellyfish adds an element of dynamic animation to the scene. Lighting and textures were carefully applied to enhance the whimsical and vibrant atmosphere.
# How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

When designing software, I focus on understanding the project requirements, creating modular structures, and using a planned approach that allows for flexibility. This project helped enhance my ability to break down tasks and visualize the final product early in the process, which is invaluable for organizing development and anticipating potential challenges. My design approach for this project involved iterative testing and refinement, ensuring each component worked independently before combining them.

This project honed my skills in modularization and function reuse, crucial for keeping code manageable and efficient. By creating specific functions for transformations, texture application, and object rendering, I was able to streamline processes and improve readability. Additionally, I gained a deeper understanding of the role of lighting and texture in visual design, which will be useful in future graphics projects.
# How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I develop programs by dividing tasks into achievable steps and iterating based on testing results. I focus on achieving functionality before refining features or enhancing performance. In the 3D scene, I used incremental testing, which helped identify and resolve issues with lighting, texture mapping, and object positioning in real-time.

While developing my 3D scene, I adopted strategies like function-based rendering and modular transformations. By creating reusable functions, I minimized redundancy, which streamlined the code and simplified debugging. I also used iteration as a core strategy, making incremental adjustments based on visual outcomes.
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
